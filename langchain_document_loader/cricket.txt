The Spirit of Cricket

Beneath the sun, the pitch gleams bright,
Batsmen poised, ready for the fight.
The ball arcs high, a graceful flight,
Fielders sprint, eyes sharp, spirits light.

Cheers erupt with every boundary made,
Sweat and dust in the summer parade.
Spin and swing, pace and power collide,
Strategy and skill walk side by side.

Umpires watch with impartial gaze,
While fans are lost in the thrilling craze.
From dawn till dusk, the battle unfolds,
Legends are born, and courage molds.

Cricket, more than a game we play,
A story of passion, day by day.
